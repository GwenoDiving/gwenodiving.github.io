# ðŸ¤¿Unforgettable Seal Team Program in Taiwan

*The PADI Seal Team is designed for young divers who are looking for
action-packed fun by completing exciting water tasks in the pool. Have you ever
wondered what it's like to dive with a flashlight, take photos underwater, or
float effortlessly like an astronaut? In addition to learning basic scuba
diving skills, the course also features specialized in-water tasks such as
wreck diving, navigation, buoyancy, environmental awareness and more. PADI Seal
Teams include doing cool things in the pool, meeting friends and sharing
adventures in the underwater world. Children must be at least 8 years old to
participate in PADI Seal Team. Children must be comfortable in the water, but
no scuba diving experience is required.*
